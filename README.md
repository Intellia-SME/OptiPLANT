# OptiPLANT
OptiPLANT is a cloud-based based system that empowers professional and non-professional data scientists to build high-quality predictive models.

## Motivation
OptiPLANT allows industries with limited human and financial
resources to set-up and deploy accurate and scalable predictive models that helps them
optimise not only the maintenance activities but also the overall energy consumption. OptiPLANT evaluates a pool of ML models, it chooses the best one, and it makes results easily
understandable by non-professionals. Industrial data is securely shared and analysed to
discover the transitions between the different system states.
